# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains various medical predictor variables and a target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Multiple classifiers are tested to select the best-performing model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of the models.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `Diabetes.ipynb` file.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Diabetes.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Files

- `Diabetes.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.

## Results

The best-performing model achieves an accuracy of approximately **[75.97]** on the test dataset.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the need for better diagnostic tools to assist healthcare professionals in identifying diabetes early.
